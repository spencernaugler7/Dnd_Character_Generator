##About This Program:

This is a program designed for veteran and new D&D player who are wanting to jump right
into a game with a level 1 fighter but appreciate being able to customize their characters
without having to go through the hundreds of pages in the books of D&D character creation.
We also provide a savable pdf that will contain your filled out character sheet for your 
newly created character!

##Iteration 3: 

#####Added Features
- Speed now prints on character sheet PDF
- User can now save their file under a different name than their character.

This is the third iteration of the Level 1 Fighter D&D Character generator, it
includes some bugfixes and maintenance for existing features, as well as some 
new features such as adding speed to the PDF, and allowing a user to change the name 
of their save file, instead of it always being the same as their character name. 
Provided under "User Stories" is the criteria in which we modeled our third iteration after.
These relate to essential features to the program and were our top priority when 
building a working program for our beloved users.
Under the "Acceptance Test Cases" are unique tests designed by us to see if the
common person can traverse through our program and complete the requested goals. 
These have been updated in accordance with iteration 3 changes. 
Finally under "Acceptance Test Peer Thoughts" are a handful of responses we have
collected after asking the subject to perform the Acceptance Tests mentioned previously.
This is insight that we will take into consideration when modeling the future iterations.

As a 5E D&D player who is playing a fighter in an upcoming campaign, I want to be able to do the following with the program:

   		- Select a subrace from a list if a previously selected race has subraces.

- Select proficient skills, but also have the program automatically remove skills already   gained from my previously chosen background.
- Have a character speed determined from my chosen race.
#####Story 4
As a 5E D&D player who is playing a fighter in an upcoming campaign, I want to be able to do the following with the program:
- I want the option to leave an entire section of the character sheet blank if I am undecided on something, and still be able to generate the sheet.
- I can have the ability to go back and change something if I change my mind
#####Story 5
As a Dnd player, I require a character sheet to be filled out for me and printed to a pdf.
- This character sheet needs to be savable.
	- I can to choose the location to save this file
		- I can name the file whatever I would like

###Acceptance Test Case:
1. Can you create a character named “Trash Boat” that is a “Hill Dwarf” 
with 16 dexterity and has the “Archery” fighting style. 
Can you go back and change your character's name to “Dr.Pepper” and change your race to “Dragonborn?”

2. With a program that is already running and a character already created, can you 
save the generated pdf to a chosen location and name it what you would like?

3. Can you select and reselect skills and backgrounds? In this case select Entertainer, then Animal Handling and Athletics. 
Then go back and change your background to Urchin, and choose acrobatics and athletics.

###Acceptance Test Peer Thoughts
Acceptance Tester 1 - I was able to use the program very easily. 
I could go back and change what i had selected previously. 
When i saved the file i could name it what i liked and put it on my desktop.

Acceptance Tester 2 - Thanks to this program I made a level 1 Hill Dwarf fighter named trash boat. 
I would use this pprogram to make fighter characters in the future. It saves you a good amount of work.

Acceptance Tester 3 - The program was easy to use and very lightweight. 
I could click through the pages without selecting certain things and come back to select them, 
and it still printed out fine. At no point was I confused or stuck with this program.

Acceptance Tester 4 - It looks very nice and would be very usefule for someone creating a level 1 fighter. 
I would like there to be more background and race options. Still it is a great program and 
I was able to do all the testswith no problems 

Acceptance Tester 5 - I don't know a lot about dungeons and dragons but 
I feel that this program would help a beginner like me a lot. It tells me exactly what I need to choose and fill out, 
and it puts everything in its spot on the convenient pdf. I feel like I know a lot more about dungeons and 
dragons after using this program
